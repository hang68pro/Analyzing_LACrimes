Analyzing Crimes in Los Angeles
This is a project to support the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) by analyzing crime data to identify patterns in criminal behavior. 
They plan to use the insights to allocate resources effectively to tackle various crimes in different areas.
They have provided you with a single dataset to use. A summary and preview are provided below.
It is a modified version of the original data, which is publicly available from Los Angeles Open Data.

Using this dataset, they are asking questions about 
1. Which hour has the highest frequency of crimes?
2. Which area has the largest frequency of night crimes? (crimes committed between 10pm and 3:59am)
3. Identify the number of crimes committed against victims of different age groups
4. Build a ML model to predict the area with the highest frequency of night crimes?
